This folder contains activies that are desgigned to help you do slightly more sophisticated analysis with the OpenCosmo toolkit and compute portal. If you haven't already check out [Getting Started](/00-Getting-Started)

### Activities

- For a mass range and redshift slice of your choice, examine how the concentration-mass relation in the SCIDAC runs changes as a function of one of the hydrodynamic subgrid parameters.*

- Pick one of the subgrid parameters that is varied across the hydro simulations. How does the relationship between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass change as a function of these parameters?

- On Polaris, load up the halo properties for each of the 5 available redshift slices. Produce a plot which shows the evolution of the halo mass function over these redshifts.
