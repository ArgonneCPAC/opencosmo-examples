This folder contains activies that are desgigned to cover more advanced use cases. Many of them will require you to directly interact with the data at ALCF, rather than using the portal. However the toolkit is built to handle these kinds of complex use cases, so you don't have to start from scratch! 

If you haven't already, check out the [getting started](/00-Getting-Started) and [intermediate](/01-Intermediate) activities.

### Tutorials

- Load the particle data and profile data from a cluster-mass halo, visualize the halo and plot the profile

- Investigate lightcone data

### Activities

- Fit an NFW profile to the radial profiles in a sample of halos of your choice from the Frontier-E simulation. Plot the relationship between m_200_c and r_200_c for your fits. Compare your results to the values of these parameters already present in the catalog.

- On Polaris, load halo and galaxy properties for one of the SCIDAC runs at a few different redshifts. Examine how the relationship between halo and stellar mass evolves over cosmic time. How does this change in the other SCIDAC sims?
