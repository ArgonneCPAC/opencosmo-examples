CosmoExplorer Examples
======================

This repo contains examples uses of the CosmoExplorer compute portal and OpenCosmo toolkit. They are split into three categories:

- [Getting Started](/00-Getting-Started): Great if you are new to working with cosmological simulations or are just getting a feel for the portal and toolkit.
- [Intermediate](/01-Intermediate): A good next step once you have a familiarity with the toolkit and portal.
- [Advanced](/02-Advanced): More sophisticated activities that require some of the more powerful features of the toolkit or have to churn through significant amounts of data. May require you to bypass the portal and operate on the data directly.

Some of the activities have notebooks with walkthroughs. Others are left for you to figure out :)
