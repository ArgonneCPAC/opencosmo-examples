Getting Started
---------------

This folder contains activies that are desgigned to get you started working with the comptue portal and toolkit for the first time. Some of these activities have notebooks which guide you through the process.

### Activities

For a mass range and redshift slice of your choice, plot the concentration-mass relationship for halos in the Frontier-E Simulation.

For a mass range and redshift slice of your choice, plot the relationship between halo mass and stellar mass in one of the SCIDAC simulations. 

Using the compute portal, retrieve a sample of halos of your choice from two different redshifts. Examine the relationship between the FoF and SOD halo masses. What does this tell you about the evolution of these structures over cosmic time?
